Test to check consistency of Sire main code for neopentane -> methane

##############
USAGE from scratch:

1) python prepare.py  feset_input_perturbations/sire/ethane~methane
and so on for all the pert

2) bash cluster.sh

3) Once everything is finished (hopefully) fine:
   python collect_average.py


##############
The inputfiles are created with FESetup and store in fesetup_input folder

prepare.py  prepare all the simulations to be setup automatically:

e.g.

python prepare.py  fesetup_input/_perturbations/sire/ethane~methane

input files are copied form protocol/ folder


cluster.sh is the script to run all the simulations:
bash cluster.sh


Once everysimulation is finished, (hopefully) water and vacuum analysis should start

Once everything is finished, final data can be collected through collect_average.py:

python collect_average.py

It creates the folder output_results  where are stored:

VALUES.dat:  comparison between Spline interpolation free energy
				TI regression scheme
				MBAR
	     for all the perturbation and the finale neopentane~methane relative f.e.

perturbation folders/ :  gradients profile in water and vacuum are stored here
