Try to replicate a simualtion as described by konig in ( Konig and Brooks Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 2015, 932-943 ) 

Vacuum only simulations: 

free_varying:  no LJ no charges for HC to HH with and without constraints, free to vary the bond length when dummy, free to vary the k 
	       amplitude when dummy
varying_all : no LJ no charges for HC to HH with and without constraints, here the bond length and amplitude k are varying from initial 
		to final state
varying_legnth: no LJ no charges for HC to HH with and without constraints, here only the bond legnth are varying

varying_amplitude: here only the amplitude k of the bond
