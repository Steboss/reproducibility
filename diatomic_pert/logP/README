Simulation in gas, water and cyclohexane phase of CH to CH modifying the bond length ONLY

C and H have the same LJ terms and 0.00 charges
the amplitude of C-H bond is 337.3 kcal/molA2  and the bond length varies from 1.092 to 3.0 A

Important: for the simulation in cyclohexane the C and H atom type was changed, in order to avoid 
misunderstanding between cyclohexane molecules and solute
